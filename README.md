# Introduction

- This repository is a collection of resources dedicated to help understand and create design systems.
- Links to other repos, Articles, etc,
- It can serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about design systems or implementing them in their projects.

It is a work in progress and will be updated as I find more resources.

# Sharing is Caring

Three pillars of design systems :

- **Design Language**
- **Component Library - Core Components**
- **Style Guide**

When creating a design system, different development tasks can be challenging and time-consuming. However, some development tasks are commonly considered more tedious like creating a component library, lot of questions arise like :

> what are the different approaches to create a component library?

_1st option_ — build everything from scratch — Manual Creation

- This is the most time-consuming option, it offers complete control and customization but can be time-consuming and may require more development effort.

_2nd option_ — use a UI Libraries/CSS Frameworks —

- This is the fastest option, but it gives you the least control over the final product.

_3rd option_ — Hyrid Approach — combine the 1st and 2nd options

Let's explore the 2nd option:
When it comes to use an existing UI library it's not always easy to customize to fit our design system's needs.

> So what are the different approaches to customize or extend or workarounds to use an existing UI library ?

- **find a themeable library (that supports theming) and adapt to your needs** - work in progress : Need to POC this approach
- **find a library that you can use as a foundation and build on top** - work in progress : Need to POC this approach
- **Headless components / Unstyled components** - work in progress : Need to POC this approach
- Find other approaches...

the objective is to POC the different approaches and find the best approach that fits our needs considering the following criteria :

- **Customization** - how easy is it to customize the components ?
- **Time to market** - how fast can we deliver the components ?
- **Extensibility** - how easy is it to extend the components ?
- **Accessibility** - how accessible are the components ?
- **Maintenance** - how easy is it to maintain the components ?
